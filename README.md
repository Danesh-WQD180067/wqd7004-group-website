This project aims to identify the impact of various economic freedoms on national productivity.

## Objectives

1.	Predict per-capita socioeconomic status (SES) of a nation based on changes to their economic freedom
2.	Determining the most efficient regression algorithm for predicting SES based on economic freedom

## Scenarios

1. Identify global trends on economic freedoms and socioeconomic status
2. Visualizing correlation between SES and economic freedom 
    - Identify highly correlated attributes
3. Developing models to predict SES based on economic freedom metrics
4. Scoring models based on their effectiveness in predicting SES scores
